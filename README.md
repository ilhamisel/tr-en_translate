# Neural Machine Translation System from Turkish to English for Academic Translations


English is widely accepted as the language of academic publication all over the world. This situation causes academicians and graduate students who speak other languages to encounter some difficulties in writing articles and reading published articles. This problem is also valid for academics in Turkey. Although they have a certain level of English, many of the articles they write may be inaccurate. In such cases, secondary sources are needed. These resources can be automatic translation programs or people with advanced English grammar skills. In this study, a Turkish-English academic translation system is presented to solve this problem. For this neural translation system, a parallel corpus composed entirely of academic sentences was used. The created parallel corpus consists of more than 1.2M sentences. A shallow fusion model with transformer-based architecture is proposed for the translation system. With the created model, errors in writing and reading English articles were tried to be minimized. Different metrics were used to evaluate the created model. The model created as a result of the experiments achieved 44.2 BLEU and 72.1 METEOR score. In addition, the created model achieved results above 20 BLEU scores with the zero-shot translation method in the World Machine Translation(2017-2018) test datasets.
